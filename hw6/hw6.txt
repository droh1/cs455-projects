//HW 6 Write Up

In the timing tests for hw6, the raw time values are the shortest at the smallest N and get larger as the N becomes larger.
However, when looking at the normalized time values, the time values showed the same trend but showed a much smaller increase
per N increase compaired to the raw time value.

- While the time increased, the normalized time value shows that the computations are occuring at roughtly the same rate. While
  the time it takes for the operation at larger N's take longer, the main slowdown seems to be related to hardware. The cache
  seems to suspect as its clear that at larger N's the cache is not big enough to hold all of the data, thus leading to some
  slowdown.
